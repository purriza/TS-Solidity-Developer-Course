APPROACHING/SOLUTION

ThreeSigmaNFT.sol

We have 2 interactions with this contract:

- Users have to mint a NFT before entering the Challenge -> mintNFT function (Mints the NFT and then transfers it to the Challenge.sol)
- Challenge.sol has to transfer the NFTs to the winner -> awardNFT function

Challenge.sol

Since we have 2 challenges running at the same time and both have to keep the timer and the currentWinner, a struct to save this data seems nice -> struct ChallengeData
Then we also need to store the tokenIds in order to be able to transfer them to the winner -> uint256[] NFTtokenIds

We have to control when users deposit ETH (function receive()) or NFT (IERC721Receiver onERC721Received), in both situations we have to check if the 
Challenge has already ended (modifier CheckTimer).
In case that the Challenge is still up -> We update the timer (block.timestamp) and the currentWinner (msg.sender)
In case that the Challenge has ended -> Require message

Since the SmartContract by itself cant send a transaction, we have to add 2 methods in order to be able to check if the Challenges have ended and award the winners
ETHChallenge -> Sending all the contract balance to the winners address
NFTChallenge -> Transfering all the NFTs to the winners address
